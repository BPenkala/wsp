			<h3>School Policies</h3>
			<h4>Tardies</h4>
			<p>Students should be in the classroom by 7:50 a.m. All students that arrive at 7:50 a.m. need to be checked in through the front office by their parent.</p>
			<p>Before 8:00 a.m., students will report to the classroom if late for school and the teacher will write a tardy slip.  One copy of the tardy slip should be stapled in the child's planner and the second copy is for teacher records.  This data should be saved and utilized to document children with excessive tardies (see #4 & #5 below).</p>
			<p>After 8:00 a.m. all students who are tardy will be sent to the front office and the front office staff will document the late arrival and notify the teacher.  The teacher will write a tardy slip, staple one copy to the planner and keep the other copy for their records.</p>
			<p>A student who accumulates FIVE AND ONE-HALF (5.5 hours or 330 minutes) of absence due to tardiness during the regular school day, without documented reason for EXCUSED ABSENCE , shall be deemed absent for one school day.  The student will receive 0's for all work for one school day .</p>
			<h3>Unexcused Tardies</h3>
			<p>The following procedures will take place when there are excessive unexcused tardies:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>3 UNEXCUSED TARDIES</strong>- the teacher must notify the parent by phone call or conference (documentation of contact should be in writing on conference form).  Teacher MUST go through the attendance policy with the parent to let them know that after 6 tardies, "EXCESSIVE TARDIES" will be marked on progress report and report card AND a letter will be mailed home and placed in the child's file. After 15 unexcused tardies an after school detention will be assigned. Also teacher must notify parent/guardian of 0's for unexcused absence/tardies.</li>
					<li><strong>6 UNEXCUSED TARDIES</strong>-  guidance will mail home the Principal's Letter.  The letter should be signed by the parent and sent back to school.</li>
					<li><strong>12 UNEXCUSED TARDIES</strong>- the teacher must notify the parent by phone call or conference (documentation of contact should be in writing on conference form).  Teacher MUST go through the attendance policy with the parent to let them know that after 15 unexcused tardies, after school detention will be assigned. Also the teacher must notify the parent that the student will receive 0's for all work missed due to unexcused tardies.
					15 UNEXCUSED TARDIES an after school detention will be assigned.</li>
					<li><strong>15 UNEXCUSED TARDIES</strong>- an after school detention will be assigned.</li>
				</ul>
			<p><strong>REPEAT THE PROCESS FOR ANY SUBSEQUENT TARDIES</strong></p>
